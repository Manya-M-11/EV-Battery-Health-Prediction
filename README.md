The EV Battery Life Prediction System uses Machine Learning (ML) and Generative AI (GenAI) to estimate the State of Health (SOH) and Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries.
It helps users monitor battery performance, predict future degradation, and get smart AI-based maintenance recommendations.

Features:
* Predicts battery health (SOH) using real or synthetic NASA battery data.

* Estimates Remaining Useful Life (RUL) in charging cycles.

* Generates personalized care recommendations using GenAI logic.

* Includes Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost models.

* Can be extended into a web app using Flask (backend) and React (frontend)
